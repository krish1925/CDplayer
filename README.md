# CD player

A C++ project which takes commands/instructions for a CD-Player in the form of a string, and under certain rules must show different properties of the instructions, such as whether it was a valid string, was the CS player left open, does the CD player still have a CD inserted, etc. This is then tested using multiple valid and invalid strings and the output is displayed for each input.
